### Known Issues

- Tested with Diablo II: Resurrected v1.4.71336 (PTR 2.5) and Diablo II Classic v1.14d **(It has unit test confirming it supports all versions of the d2s file format, but the files used in testing, other than v1.14d and D2R files, have not been tested in a real game)**
- Starting with Diablo II Classic V1.13c the maximum gold in your stash no longer depends on your character's level, and is now a flat cap of 2,500,000 instead.  The editor will now use this value when editing Resurrected files or Classic files marked as v1.10 or higher when determining the limit for your gold in your stash.
- For changes to take effect, you must not have Diablo II running and you should close the character file before playing Diablo II.

<br>

**Version 2.00 (June 18, 2021)**<br>
- Updated: Converted from a C++ Builder 5 project to a Visual Studio 2019 project<br>
- Updated: Changed Main Dialog to resemble the in-game Character Stats screen.<br>
- Updated: Changed Waypoint and Quest Dialogs to remove tabs and display all in initial screen<br>
- Updated: In the Quest dialog, changed to tri-state checkboxes so either a quest is not started, started or completed fully<br>
- Updated: Changed Skills dialog to show all the skill under their category as displayed in the game in one screen.<br>
- Updated: The logic to upgrade gems to the perfect quality to use same logic as the GPS converter code added in the 1.93 version for consistent handling of gem/potion conversions.<br>
- Updated: The editor now works with v1.10 of the character file. It now reads/writes all sections properly and also handles Corpse, Merc and Golem sections. The maximum character stats have also been adjusted to match the limits due to the file structure.<br>
- Updated: use std::error_code to hold error codes from file open or save operations.<br>
- Updated: The original Diablo II icon with transparent background is used.<br>
- Updated: Level Requirements will show requirements using the version of from the character file. V1.10 is assumed to have the latest Level Requirements from Diablo II 1.14b, while versions 1.07-1.09 will level requirements for those versions and any version below 1.07 will show the level requirements that existed since 1.00. When loading the Level Requirements dialog with no character file opened, it will assume the latest file version.<br>

- Updated: Modified item reading logic to be able to read D2R v1.0.x - v1.1.x character files.<br>
- Updated: File reading will now use read/write share mode again but cpp file has _MSC_VER guard around thus allowing the file to still be portable in theory. This means you can once again open a file already opened by the game or something else but it is still recommended you do not have it open by anything else.<br>
- Updated: namespace d2ce is now part of all non-MFC classes, i.e. the portable code. This quickly identifies what is part of UI logic and what is part of the core.<br>
- Updated: Max Everything menu item to also make all potions the best quality, all gems and skulls perfect, all stackable items fully filled and all weapons and armor have max durability.<br>
- Updated: Max Everything will not make all stats their maximum bit value and all Skill have the max value of 20. Instead it will change the stats points and skill point yet to distribute value to be what the maximum earned points would be in a game. The user can still make all skill points be 20 in the Skills dialog and can edit the stat values to be maximum if they wish to have values beyond of what is possible in a game.<br>
- Updated: Check Character now checks for more possible issues, like one of the stats having points lower than minimum expected value.<br>
<br>

- Added: Upgrades from potions of any quality to potions of highest quality as well as potions of any kind to Full Rejuvenation potions. These operations are available under the Upgrade submenu of the Options main menu.<br>
- Added: Hotkey to the View, Reload menu item (can use F5 to reload the currently opened file).<br>
- Added: Check for Dead Hardcore character added during opening a Character file allowing user mark a dead hardcore character as alive again. The "Check character" option also performs this check.<br>
- Added: MRU support so you can easily open previously opened files.<br>
- Added: New ActInfo class separates the logic of handling Quest and Act information to simplify and make less error prone other parts of the code.<br>
- Added: Max Quantity For All Stackables menu item that fully fills all stackables.<br>
- Added: Max Durability For All Items which makes all Armour and Weapons have maximum durability without being indestructible.<br>
- Added: Reset Stats menu item under Options which will do exactly what Akara does after completing The Den of Evil.<br>
<br>

- Removed: "Remove New Skills" menu item was remove as that functionality is now part of the "Check Character" menu item.<br>
<br>
